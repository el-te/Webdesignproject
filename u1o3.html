                My review in terms of tools and systems of IT to increase efficiency in making my website, I could've been
                more productive by identifying two or three crucial tasks that deserve my full attention and make them a
                priority to increase efficiency in making the website. 
                Creating a library of code snippets,collection of favorite and often-used snippets and make sure that it’s easily searchable and well organized.
                Increase comfort for certain devices and software, provide information on short-cuts that can
                reduce the time spent on tasks and perhaps working as a team to Increase productivity and confidence in a
                shared ability to complete a job.

           <p>
            One of the ways I can describe improvement efficiency and  productivity is by giving example of 3 lists of keyboard shortcuts:

            1) Ctrl+Alt+Tab this lets me switch between all my open applications.
            2) ctrl+c this lets me quickly copy text. 
            3) ctrl+v this shortcut lets me quickly paste what i have copied.
            
            keyboard shortcuts are very useful because there's less time clicking and typing this will make you do your work quicker and makes you more productive. The same goes for a bookmark that records a web address so it's quicker to access in the future. Also PowerPoint tools can be very useful when making a presentation. Tools like master slide can help because you could edit one slide to how you want it and you can use that for the whole presentation.

            would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
    
           <p>
            Solutions to improve my own development in digital projects, yes  i would definitely do it differently and mostly like work as a team and get near and far closer together with communication software. Because its well known fact effectiveness in communication is crucial for a team's productivity. Slack was also a very useful workspace, in Slack, collegues and i can send messages and share files in channels or any other work realated assets about the course. We can create channels for teams, projects, office locations, or anything else.
            I can also make private channels for conversations that shouldn’t be open to all members, or i can use shared channels to collaborate with my collegues outside.

            <h2 class="h1cont"></h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    
           <p>
            One of the solutions would be to plan the testing and QA processes test. It should be well planned, defined, and documented. Good documentation is the tool that builds efficient communication within the digital software team.
            
            I would make a test plan brief to avoid repetition or irrelevance. It should contain only the relevant information. Being specific Include all details, e.g. editions and versions of the programs, to make the document searchable and updating a test plan. It’s a live document that must be frequently updated on an on-demand basis.
