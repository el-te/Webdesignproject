                your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,

                <p>
                My review and approach on certain IT tools  used such as Visual Studio is far better and understandable for me to use, compared with Codepen, which is the one I started with, I managed to understand the playground for the front-end side of the web. Allows me to create “pens”, which  are sets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Same  goes for Trello,  it is a great collaboration tool that helps me to organize my projects into boards, what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where the document is in  process. It's practically a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for me and my team.

                Visual Studio is the simplicity and combination of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. 
                VS code features are perfect. It has support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps me to be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and much more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings which lets me navigate my learning code with ease.

            <p>

            The visual studio is the best application. I was using a desktop application and web application, it secures multiple languages. I am happy to use it because of it's intellisense.
            I have been using this software for the past two weeks and i am very satisfied, it has a wide range of functionality it allows me to develop a variety of applications and websites with intellisense, the coding feels smooth and fun to do.
            By far Trello is the most popular way to  track tasks in either projects or processes. Projects tend to have a start and end date, like planning an event or building a new feature, whereas processes tend to be ongoing, like day to day operations for a business, or managing an editorial calendar.

            your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
            interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
        <p>
            I am happy with the website to a certain extent. I would like that website to be responsive with different
            web browsers and scalable to use different devices screen sizes. I would also implement javascript and make
            it more user friendly and i would make navigation more user friendly too. I've found that my website does
            not follow a consistent theme.
            The strength of the website, i have done to a standard than i expected given the time frame and it has good
            aesthetics and layout, the website provides many different pages and dropdown menus which are well evindest.
            It contains navigation for usability. Its clear and concise with appropriate amount of white spaces with
            minimalistic look.

        <p>
            Further improvements that i would have made is probably the first thing to do, making sure all websites
            content are up to date. I would also Update Homepage Page, add more calls to action to get more conversions
            (leads, sales, etc.)
            Upgrade Software/Plugins to Keep the website's software updated helps ensure it runs quickly/smoothly and it
            absolutely helps to ensure the website doesn't get hacked.

       <p>

        The website was tested out on multiple family members. The navigation was constant and everything as it should. There was an  issue with the navigation dropdown menu on the button, where it covered the contact menu button. This would be an easy fix by just changing which side the drop down comes from. Another issue was the full background image on the home page did not recises correctly in different screen sizes and laptops.
