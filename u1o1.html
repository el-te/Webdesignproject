            <p></p>

            IT
            stands for; Information technology (or IT) is defined as “ the application of computers and internet to
            store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data or information.



            The
            importance and purpose of IT in modern business setting is evident, from small businesses run by single
            person to huge multinational corporations. Computer technology is vital across the business world in every
            department in business operations in the modern
            world.


            Without
            information technology and system support, business simply stops! If the internet or phone services goes
            down in an office, nothing can get done ,ex; HR finance, operations, communications, sales and any other
            departments depends on functional computers and
            information systems to do their work. IT and IS protect the integrity of data and keeps it safe from a world
            of technological
            threats.

                successfully- what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?.</h2>
            <p>

                “ Science of planning, executing, initiating, managing and implementing projects in given time” ( Steve
                Parker)


                Digital projects are expected to have a diverse skills set and the responsibility on their job role. To
                make a project successfully, it would help to illustrate the project with manageable sections. That will
                estimate the duration of the project and tasks, so that you are able to schedule resources for the
                project. One of the techniques is, the use of (CPM) which allows to project the structure and duration.


                Digital Project Managers skills are essential, such as writing, either if it is a blog post, support
                documents, workflows. Having a good understanding in programming languages such as HTML, CSS and
                Javascript. Also the ability to write and editing copywriting, social media skills, problem solving and
                presentation skills that influences others and delivering the project and the upper management in style.

                The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for clients to see who I am and what I do to provide
                consultant
                work for clients on webdesings, the website also would be used as mine eportfolio when applying for jobs to
                show what i
                have done.
                I decided that the audience of the website wouldn be potential business people , therefore I chose a colour
                screen
                accordingly to be catchy, vibrant and interesting.I would use adobe photoshop to create my logo ET
                consultancy website.
                My plan to carry out tasks using IT was by doing research in different websites online layouts on how
                navigation
                pictures are positioned. Then I went on to draw out my 1st home page on paper before implementing. On the
                homepage I
                wanted to have a nav link to other pages such as my profile, portfolio and contacts pages, so that when you
                navigate to
                the profile pages you'll see the first thing to do was to bring all the contente together. So my portfolio
                page contains
                on how to plan and design websites. On the contacts I have my contact details telephone number and email
                address and
                also i'll put a form to send direct messages.

        <h2 class="h1cont">The risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail?
            Why?</h2>

        <p>

            “The causes of digital transformation failure are complex and multifaceted. From inadequate change
            management to culture gaps and skills shortage, as many as 90 percent of projects risk missing their
            intended targets”.
            (S. Writer 2019)


            One of the main impacts of digital projects to fail is the shortage of resources for digital
            transformation. These resources include skill gaps, a limited technical talent pool, and lack of buy-in
            from business leaders, which impedes proper funds allocation. As a result, digital transformation
            projects run into delays and ambiguous directions, leading to sunk costs for the company.

            Choosing software is not a quick or easy process. Choosing the right package alone doesn’t
            guarantee success. Don’t forget to allocate time and money to managing installation,
            integration into the current business and staff training, as well as ongoing monitoring and
            maintenance. (Terry Hopper)

            . Knowing your objective. The first step in choosing the right software is knowing what you
            want the software to do.

            . Create a comprehensive list of software requirements

            . Start searching for relevant applications, at this point , it's good to create a long list
            of all possible software packages.

            . Start excluding solutions, aim in this step is to identify unsuitable entries as quickly
            as possible

            . Start trialling your selected software, the most time-consuming part of the process.
            Because it takes time, you need to be smart about your evaluation process.

            . Do your due diligence, you will have a good idea of which system you will be using.

            . Start negotiating, This is where it is all finalised the finer details of the system.

            Trello has helped me and allowed me to break up the project as a whole into much smaller easier segments. I
            was able to have a visual presentation of what needed to be done, because the list item progress bar for
            each item that has been completed.

            impact digital projects?.</h2>

        <p>


            The demanding nature of the General Data Protection Regulation as known as (GDPR) has forced businesses to
            re-think the way they conduct their activities when using personal data. Since Facebook data breach
            Cambridge Analytica scandal, however, the Cambridge Analytica scandal will have wider repercussions for any
            organisation that holds data on its clients. After all, if a person’s data can be harvested through their
            Facebook profiles (or any other social media platforms) along with millions of others in order to manipulate
            political opinions and potentially influence elections, people are going to become very wary about what
            their data is being used for.
            Even before the Cambridge Analytica scandal came to light, GDPR – the General Data Protection Regulation –
            announced a new set of rules that companies have to abide by or face serious fines. Facebook’s very public
            disgrace has however brought the issue to the forefront of everyone’s minds. ( David Cauchi )
            In the digital environment projects, marketing is certainly not an exception, especially whether your
            organisation conducts data analysis concerning its customers’ online activity or whether it simply uses a
            mailing list to send electronic marketing, such activities need to be framed within the context of the
            stricter obligations imposed under the GDPR.
            In addition, as if the GDPR was not enough, the processing of personal data involving electronic
            communications, should also consider specific rules contained under the e-Privacy regime. This is currently
            being remodelled in a stricter regulation which will bring the existing framework into balance with the
            rules applied under the GDPR.
