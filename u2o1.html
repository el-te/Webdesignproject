            <p>
                I started off by creating an index page, I have also created divs called containers in which would be
                the main div that will hold all the descendant child divs. Then I used external style sheets.
                I have searched the internet on how to position divs, I have discovered flexbox layout to position the
                two main divs on the home page side by side.

                In the container on the left i created an unordered list to hold the navigation menu, which contains
                hyperlinks to all the different pages within the project button. There is a drop down menu which appears
                when hovering over it. The right side div was splitting into two further divs side by side which
                contains a small bio about myself.
                The home page has a background image which fills the whole area. I added an overlay to the area to
                darken the image.

                The project page I have added a navigation bar to the top of the page discontains a elements aligned
                horizontally. For the main body I used a div which spanned the full width of the page and within it
                another div which spanned 60 percent of that. Iâ€™ve changed the background color to a dark with white
                writing. I just wish had more time within the course project to improve the website.
