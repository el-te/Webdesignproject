         <p>

                I started off by creating an index page, I have also created divs called containers in which would be
                the main div that will hold all the descendant child divs. Then I used external style sheets.
                I have searched the internet on how to position divs, I have discovered flexbox layout to position the
                two main divs on the home page side by side.

                In the container on the left i created an unordered list to hold the navigation menu, which contains
                hyperlinks to all the different pages within the project button. There is a drop down menu which appears
                when hovering over it. The right side div was splitting into two further divs side by side which
                contains a small bio about myself.
                The home page has a background image which fills the whole area. I added an overlay to the area to
                darken the image.

                The project page I have added a navigation bar to the top of the page discontains a elements aligned
                horizontally. For the main body I used a div which spanned the full width of the page and within it
                another div which spanned 60 percent of that. I’ve changed the background color to a dark with white
                writing. I just wish had more time within the course project to improve the website.

                What is copyright law? Copyright is a law that gives the creator of the work the ability to keep his/her
                work for themselves, and only copied by some other people with their permission.
                
                Does copyright law protect us? People can not steal work from other people and say that they are the
                real creators of it, if we were to break the copyright law? A polite letter or email from the author
                asking you to remove the material from your website, sometimes authorities might step in and send you to
                jail, it all depends on the work the person has committed or have taken without permission.
                Best way to avoid breaking this law, to ask for permission to use that work.

                Computer Misuse Act
                The misuse of the computer; it is designed to protect computer users against wilful attacks and theft of
                information.
                
                It protects us from the theft of information and wilful attacks.
                People who break the Computer Misuse Act, could be arrested for up to 6 months
                The best way to avoid breaking this law is, to avoid breaking the Computing Misuse Act, you should not
                try to hack other peoples computers and access their personal information.

            account - describe issues that people with
            disabilities may face when using webpages and
            how we can overcome them</h2>

        <p>
            People with disabilities already face significant challenges in employment and education. Persons with
            disabilities face unemployment at more than three times higher levels than the rest of the population and
            suffer similar gaps in educational attainment. Yet 75% of people with disabilities who are not employed want
            to work.
            
            The main reason for this is not a lack of interest or education, but that the Internet is inherently
            unfriendly to many different kinds of disabilities. People of differing abilities obviously face different
            challenges in accessing the Internet.
            
            According to the Office for National Statistics, in May 2015, 27% of disabled adults had never used the
            internet, compared to 11% of non-disabled adults. The lack of alternative modalities for information on Web
            sites, for instance lack of alternative text that can be converted to audio to supplement visuals, or the
            lack of captions for audio and distracting visual or audio elements that cannot easily be turned off.
            Learning disabilities, depending on their nature, may face the same barriers, and the list goes on.
            
            As Technology evolves day by day, there is something readly positive
            available to almost anyone, anywhere and that includes people with disabilities in some cases.
            Many of today’s devices and platforms have various accessibility features built in. For example, iPhones
            have VoiceOver and speech options for people with impaired vision. They have hearing aid volume controls and
            flash features for those who are hearing impaired, and AssistiveTouch if you struggle with touching the
            screen.
            
            Websites like Facebook have accessibility options as well, which may come as a surprise to people who aren’t
            aware of them. For example, Facebook supports Voice Over and screen readers.
            I believe in the near future we all gonna be able to use any type of technology in our day by day lives.

        <h1 class="h1cont">Unit 2 (1.7)</h1>
        <h2 class="h1cont">Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>

    <p>


            The most appropriate file type for websites are, the so-called the “big four” - JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG but I
            will list a few more.
            JPG/ is 16-bit JPEG format (usually written without the E), and was designed with photographs in mind. It is
            capable of displaying millions of colours at once, without the need for dithering, allowing for the complex
            blend of hues that occur in photographic images.
            
            Then we have GIF, Graphics Interchange Format, Compuserve’s 8-bit GIF format has long been the most popular
            on the Internet, mainly because of its small size. It is ideal for small navigational icons and simple
            diagrams and illustrations where accuracy is required.GIFs can be animated, which is another reason they
            became so successful.
            
            
            Next in line is PNG (Portable Network Graphics) was invented in 1995 to replace the GIF and to get around
            some pesky patent issues. If the size of your file is not a pain point, and you’re working with a more
            complex image, PNG is probably the best choice.
            
            The latest of all the file types, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image file format released in
            2001, and is more powerful than other file formats suitable for the web. Unlike raster formats seen in JPG,
            GIF, and PNG, an SVG image remains crisp and clear at any resolution or size.
            That’s because an SVG is drawn from mathematically declared shapes and curves, not pixels. 
            
            There are many
            more besides those mentioned above such as .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language files, is a computer
            language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to
            the Internet.
            
            CSS — Cascading StyleSheet CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their
            websites look.
            MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to
            the PC and is hugely popular. That concludes the description of the most appropriate file types for
            websites.
